# Serverless Component Templates

These templates contain pre-made Serverless Component projects. They are excellent starting points for all types of use-cases. We continue to add to these.

Aside from installing dependencies, all you have to do to deploy these is run the `$ serverless` command with the [Serverless Framework](https://www.github.com/serverless/serverless).

Enjoy,
Serverless Inc.
